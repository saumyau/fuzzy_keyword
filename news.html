   <pre> Chinese researchers from Nanjing University have developed an 
encrypted search mechanism which they say is both more productive and 
secure than existing systems.Existing systems can search encrypted 
data only for exact keyword matches and nothing similar. Authors of
such systems can employ fuzziness to detect phrases but at the expense 
of accuracy.Li Chen, Xingming Sun, Zhihua Xia, and Qi Liu of the 
Nanjing University of Information Science said their system dubbed 
Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) spat out both exact matching files and 
those close to it through fuzzy searches.
